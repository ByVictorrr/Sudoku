No region can contain any duplicate digits.\n-In a sudoku region each digit appears exactly once. For example, if a digit appears in a row, it cannot be in any other cell in the row.\n-Likewise, each digit can appear in a cage only once. If a digit is in a cage, it cannot appear in that cage again. \n\nRule of Necessity \n\n-This rule can be applied to sudoku regions (i.e., row, column, or nonet) or to a cage.\n-In the former case, each region must contain all the digits one to nine. Thus, if all the digits but one appear in a row, the missing digit must appear in the empty cell.\n\nRule of 45\n\n-Each sudoku region (i.e., row, column, or nonet) contains the digits one through nine. Thus, each sudoku region has a total value of 45. If S is the sum of all the cages contained entirely in a region, then the cells not covered must sum to 45-S.\n\nRule of K\n\n-The Rule-of-k is an extension of the Rule-of-1. If there are k cells contained entirely in a region that contain exactly k different possible values, then no other cell in that region can contain any of those k values.\n\n Sum Elimination\n\n-This strategy examines the different possible ways of making the sum of a cage. Reducing the number of different possible ways of making a sum, can often lead to a potential solution. There are many ways of reducing the number of sums. For example, if a 2-cage has a total of 3, 4, 16, or 17 there is only one combination of values that can be used. (3=2+1, 4=3+1, 16=9+7, and 17=9+8.) 3-cages with only 1 combination are: 6=1+2+3, 7=1+2+4, 23=9+8+6, 24=9+8+7. The sum calculator found in the online player page can be very handy.";
